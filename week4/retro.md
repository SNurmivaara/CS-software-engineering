# A quick look into 2 kinds of retrospectives

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

Usage: A quick retrospective (10-25 minutes) on what should be continued and what should be adjusted/stopped altogether.

Materials needed: Marker, flip chart paper

Process:

1. Draw a circle on a poster, divide it into 5 sections and write the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of" around each section.
2. Ask: What should we start doing that perhaps we haven't done yet? What should we stop doing, that's not contributing or is getting in our way? What is working that we want to continue to do? What should we do more of? Less of?"
3. Encourage comments in any category. Clarify what category the comment belongs in, and record the comment (or summary of it) on the poster. Use silence - wait for comments.

## Glad, Sad, Mad

Usage: Participants list things in "I'm Glad/Sad/Mad" manner taking up to 60 minutes.

Materials: post-its, flip chart, markers

1. for 15 minutes participants write issues, tasks or observations on post-its
2. Next 15 minutes: flip chart(s) are divided into 3 columns: glad, sad and mad and each note gets distributed to the one the person who created it thinks it belongs. Distinction between "Sad" and "Mad" is that mad is aimed more for things that might originate outside of the team, which can be valuable to aknowledge but aren't as easy to approach (Even "off-topic" issues such as "in the mornings there isn't enough coffe because our coffee machine sucks")
3. 5 minutes: Single person groups essentially similar issues together on the board
4. 10 minutes: Every person gets to vote on which problems to discuss. Voting could be marking a circle on the post-it they feel contains an important thingy. Typically a voting limit is needed, which should be scaled to the amount of cards. Good baseline might be 5 votes per person.
5. Rest of time: "chair" of the retrospective ie. scrummaster leads a discussion starting with the most voted card. Each comment should be either agree or disagee with actual action points suggested. The discussion ends when 1 hour is up or all issues have been discussed (whichever happens first)
